# üßæüêç Receipy

This is a simple Python script to generate receipts automatically on PDF format. All receipts are saved at `docs` folder.

Currently, I'm using it to generate receipts for my therapy sessions. Thus you can add your/your therapist infos for receipts generation on a file named `config.py`, for this, there is a `config-example.py` as a template.

## Executing

You need to have python installed on your computer and to create a virtual environment (remember to activate it). Then, install dependencies that are at `requirements.txt`.

Once finished, just run `python main.py` to execute the script.
